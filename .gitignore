# Files generated by Cursor AI that are temporary or for local use
# (Check your .cursor/ folder and memory-bank for any files you explicitly DO NOT want on Git)
# If you want to keep activeContext.md, projectbrief.md, etc., make sure they are NOT ignored.
# Based on our previous discussion, memory-bank and .cursor/rules should be tracked.
# If there are specific temporary Cursor AI files that are created and should not be tracked, add them here.
# For now, it seems the .mdc files and memory-bank are intended to be tracked.
